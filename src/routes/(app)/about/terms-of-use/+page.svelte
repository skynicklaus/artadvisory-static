				payment transaction made through the Service is a transaction between Users wishing to
				invest in a Artadvisory offering and those offering such investment and not with
				Artadvisory. Artadvisory is not a party to any payment transaction related to any such
				investment and Artadvisory is not a buyer or seller in connection with any such investment
				transaction; (c) Users may only use the Service to process a payment transaction for
				investment in a Artadvisory offering through a legitimate, bona fide sale of such product or
				service. Users may not use the Service to purchase any illegal goods or services or for any
				other underlying illegal transaction; and (d) Unless held in escrow in accordance with the
				terms governing an investment by the User, as agreed between the User and Artadvisory at the
				time of investment, all payment transactions processed through the Service are
				non-refundable to a User by Artadvisory and are non-reversible by a User through the
				Service. Users may have additional refund or charge-back rights under the agreement a User
				has with the issuer of the User's payment instrument (i.e. its credit or debit card
				agreement or bank) or applicable state and federal laws. User should review its periodic
