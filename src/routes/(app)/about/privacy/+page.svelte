					providers that assist in the administration of our Platform and our advertising and marketing
					efforts, identity verification services, data analytics companies that help us target our offerings,
					marketing partners, IRA services providers. We may need to share your information with these
					companies. These users may access this information so long as you are a member of the Platform.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Potential Business Combination:</b> We may also transfer your Personal Data to a third party
					as a result of a business combination, merger, asset sale, reorganization or similar transaction
					or to governmental authorities when we reasonably believe it is required by law or appropriate

					organizations or individuals if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation
					or disclosure of your information is reasonably necessary to detect or protect against fraud
					or security issues, enforce our terms of use, meet any enforceable government request, defend
					against legal claims or protect against harm our legal rights or safety. In any such event,
					and to the extent legally permitted, we will notify you and, if there are material changes

				<li>
					<b>Third-Party Sites:</b> The Platform may contain links to third party websites and may redirect
					you to third party websites. These sites include, among others, service providers who have
